## Overview

I built a simple, responsive webpage featuring a blog preview card, designed using only HTML and CSS.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: https://omarhazem02.github.io/Blog-preview-card/

## My process

 I started by analyzing the provided design and breaking it down into clear sections and individual elements. This made it easier to structure the HTML, assigning descriptive class names to each part for better readability and maintainability.

Once the HTML skeleton was complete, I worked from top to bottom, styling each section step-by-step with CSS until the design matched the challenge requirements.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned



To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

### Continued development



### Useful resources

- MDN Web Docs helped me expand my knowledge on certain topics while creating this page..
- Chat gpt Claude supported me as  mentors by helping evaluate and review my code throughout the project.
